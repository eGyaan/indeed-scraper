# indeed-scraper

## Intro

This is a simple scraper for "Data Scientist" and "Data Analyst" job postings on Indeed.com. I want to replicate [this analysis](https://dashee87.github.io/data%20science/data-scientists-vs-data-analysts-part-1/) for such jobs in the US.

## Issues

It appears Indeed no longer lists skills in their front page results. Most posting links lead to non-Indeed sites.

## To-do

* Make list of skills from previous analysis.
* Either configure a headless browser or automate crawling with Rvest. Search for words from list within each ad.
